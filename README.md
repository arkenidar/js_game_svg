# js_game_svg

This project is a modern experiment toward adapting SVG editor (e.g. Inkscape) to 2D game levels design (e.g. of jump-and-run kind).
Of course there must be something to define rules and logic of the game and that is done by JavaScript code.
HTML is what keeps elements together (a web-browser like Firefox is needed).
CSS is used to define the visual part e.g. CSS classes for visual elements of the same kind.
This should work in all web browsers on all platforms (tested on Firefox and Safari).
Input should be provided via keyboard or visual keyboard on touchscreens where keyboard is not available.
Screen size of different kind should be handled, including orientation of the screen on mobiles and tablets.
This code is a port from a similar effort in HTML 2D game (but without using SVG), currently is more similar to a rewrite, but I am importing good features from its predecessor.

Enjoy!
